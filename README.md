## What

Welcome to GeneticAI, optimizing the discovery of models using genetic programming.

Traditionally genetic programming has been highly dependant on optimizing the problem definition.
This requires a developer to take a genetic algorithm framework and develop a large amount of code
specific to the problem before an acceptable level of performance and accuracy is achieved. 
GeneticAI aims to improve the tools for discovery of genetic algorithms without compromising 
performance. Think super amino acids or sharks with lasers.
